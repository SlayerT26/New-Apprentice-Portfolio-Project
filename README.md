# New Apprentice Portfolio Project

Python project using Fortune500 company data sheets from 2020-2021. Using python and pandas, converted all the profit and revenues to million values and changed the percentages to a floating number. New dataframes were created based on the 2021 revenue and profit percentages. Created bar charts to show how many companies profited or exceeded revenues in 2021. Showed a difference of revenue and profit from the top 15 companies of 2021 with 2020.
